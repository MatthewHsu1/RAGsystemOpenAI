            "Instruction: RATE OF PERCEIVED EXERTION Heart rate is important but listening to your body also has a lot of advantages. There are more variables involved in how hard you should workout than just heart rate. Your stress level,physical health, emotional health, temperature, humidity, the time of day, the last time you ateand what you ate, all contribute to the intensity at which you should workout. If you listen toyour body, it will tell you all of these things.The rate of perceived exertion (RPE), also know as the Borg scale, was developed by Swedishphysiologist G.A.V. Borg. This scale rates exercise intensity from 6 to 20 depending upon howyou feel or the perception of your effort. The scale is as follows:Rating Perception of Effort6 Minimal 7 Very,very light8 Very,very light +9 Very light10 Very light +11 Fairly light12 Comfortable13 Somewhat hard14 Somewhat hard +15 Hard16 Hard +17 Very hard18 Very hard +19 Very,very hard20 Maximal You can get an approximate heart rate level for each rating by simply adding a zero to each rating. For example a rating of 12 will result in an approximate heart rate of 120 beats perminute. Your RPE will vary depending up the factors discussed earlier. That is the major benefitof this type of training. If your body is strong and rested, you will feel strong and your pace willfeel easier. When your body is in this condition, you are able to train harder and the RPE willsupport this. If you are feeling tired and sluggish, it is because your body needs a break. In thiscondition, your pace will feel harder. Again, this will show up in your RPE and you will train atthe proper level for that day. \n",

            "Instruction: The F80 / F83 / F85 have ten built-in programs: one Manual program (PO), five preset profiles, two user defined programs (U1 & U2) and two Heart Rate programs (HR1 & HR2). Hill The Hill program simulates going up and down a hill. The resistance in the pedals will steadily increase and then decrease during the program. Fat Burn The Fat Burn program is designed, as the name implies, to maximize the burning of fat. There are many schools of thought on the best way to burn fat but most experts agree that a lower exertion level that stays at a steady workload is the best. The absolute best way to burn fat is to keep your heart rate at around 60% to 70% of its maximum potential. This program does not use heart rate but simulates a lower, steady exertion workout. Cardio The Cardio program is designed to increase your cardiovascular function and endurance. This is exercise for your heart and lungs. It will build up your heart muscle and increase blood flow and lung capacity. This is achieved by incorporating a higher level of exertion with slight fluctuations in work. Strength The Strength program is designed to increase muscular strength in your lower body. This program will steadily increase in resistance to a high level and forces you to sustain it. This is designed to strengthen and tone your legs and glutes (muscles of the butt). Interval The Interval program takes you through high levels of intensity followed by periods of low intensity. This program increases your endurance by depleting your oxygen level followed by periods of recovery to replenish oxygen. Your cardiovascular system gets programmed to use oxygen more efficiently this way. This program also forces your body to become more efficient due to spikes in heart rate, between recovery periods. This aids in heart rate recovery from intense activities.F83/85 SPEED F83/85 INCLINE F80 SPEED F80 INCLINE F83/85 SPEED F83/85 INCLINE F80 SPEED F80 INCLINE F83/85 SPEED F83/85 INCLINE F80 SPEED F80 INCLINE F83/85 SPEED F83/85 INCLINE F80 SPEED F80 INCLINEF83/85 SPEED F83/85 INCLINE F80 SPEED F80 INCLINEPRESET PROGRAMS \n",

The display will prompt you through the programming steps or you can just press the Start key to begin the program using the preset program values for age, weight and other program specific information. 2. If enter was pressed, the Message window will display Age. You may use any of the Up/ Down or the Fast/Slow keys to adjust your age. After adjusting press the Enter key. (Note: You may press start at any time during the programming to start the program with the informa-tion you’ve already input.) 3. The Message window will now be displaying a value, which is your Body Weight. Entering the correct body weight will affect the calorie count. Use the Up/Down keys or the Fast/Slow to adjust, then press enter. A note about the Calorie display: No exercise machine can give you an exact calorie count because there are too many factors which determine exact calorie burn for a particular person. Even if someone is the exact same body weight, age and height, their calorie burn may be very different than yours. The Calorie display is to be used as a reference only to monitor improvement from workout to workout. 4. The Time window will now be displaying a value, which is total workout time desired. Use the Up/Down or the Fast/Slow keys to adjust, and then press enter. After adjusting, press the Enter key. 5. The Speed window will display the preset top speed of the selected program. Use the Up/Down or the Fast/Slow keys to adjust, and then press enter. Each program has various speed changes throughout; this allows you to limit the highest speed the program will reach at it’s peak. 6. Press Start to begin the program. The program will begin with a 3 minute warm-up. If you want to bypass this and go directly to the beginning of the program, press Start again. \n",

            "Instruction: HEART RATE PROGRAMMING CAUTION! Heart Rate programs are intended for wireless transmitter chest strap. Do not use Pulse Grip bar for Heart Rate. You must receive a strong/steady value in the heart rate window (See Using Heart Rate Transmitter section for instructions on how to use). The HR1 program has a default level that is 60% of your projected heart rate maximum. This program is geared for individuals with fat loss as a goal. The HR2 program has a default of 80% of your projected heart rate maximum. It is geared for individuals with a goal of improving cardiovascular & lung function. 1. Select HR1 or HR2 via the Program 56keys then press enter. 2. The Message window will be blinking, showing the default user’s bodyweight for this pro - gram. You may adjust it and press enter if you want or just press enter to accept the default value. 3. The Message window will now be blinking showing user’s age. Adjust and press enter or press enter to accept the default value. Adjusting Age will change the Target HR value. 4. The Time window will now be blinking. Adjust the time and press enter. 5. Now you are asked to adjust the HR1 or HR2 value. The default is 60% (HR1); (220 - age x .60); or 80% (HR2); (220 – age x .80). You may select a higher or lower number also. Adjust the number by pressing the Speed Up or Down keys (console or handrails) and press Enter to continue. 6. Now you are finished editing the settings and can begin your workout by pressing the Start key. You can also go back and modify your settings by pressing the Stop key to go back one level, or screen. 7. If you want to increase or decrease the speed at any time during the program press the Fast or Slow (console or handrail) keys. 8. During the HR program you will be able to scroll through the data in the message window by pressing the Display key. When the program ends the message window will show a summary of your workout. The summary will be displayed for a short time then the console will return to the start-up display. 9. Press Start to begin program. The program will now control the treadmill Incline to steadily increase your heart rate to the tar - get value. This process is automatic and could take upwards of five minutes, depending on how far your HR needs to go and what kind of physical shape you are in. People who are more fit will take longer to reach the target. You can make manual adjustments to the speed throughout the program. \n",

According to this theory, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth. Over time, wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society. Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital (r) than economic growth (g), and that larger fortunes generate higher returns [pp. 384 Table 12.2, U.S. university endowment size vs. real annual rate of return]\",\n          \"Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.\",\n          \"2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J. Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem. Increasing inequality harms economic growth. High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_impossible\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

According to this theory, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth. Over time, wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society. Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital (r) than economic growth (g), and that larger fortunes generate higher returns [pp. 384 Table 12.2, U.S. university endowment size vs. real annual rate of return]\",\n          \"Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.\",\n          \"2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J. Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem. Increasing inequality harms economic growth. High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_impossible\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 91,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Pharmacists acquire more preparation following pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area.\",\n          \"Lobates feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
